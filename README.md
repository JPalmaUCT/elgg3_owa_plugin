## Requires
Elgg 3.2 or higher

## Description
Enables website tracking with Open Web Analytics on your Elgg site. 

## IMPORTANT: I ran absolutely no kind of test for this plugin - I haven't 
even checked if it works with a up-to-date Open Web Analytics installation.

I just rewrote 'Phloor Analytics Piwik' (which is stable and working) 
to work with Open Web Analytics..
